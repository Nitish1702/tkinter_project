# tkinter_project
Banking System a mini responsive GUI project with tkinter


MODULE USED:-
Tkinter - The Tkinter module (“Tk interface”) is the standard Python interface to the Tk GUI toolkit. Both Tk and Tkinter are available on most Unix platforms, as well as on Windows systems.(Tk itself is not part of Python; it is maintained at ActiveState.)
Running python -m Tkinter from the command line should open a window demonstrating a simple Tk interface, letting you know that Tkinter is properly installed on your system, and also showing what version of Tcl/Tk is installed, so you can read the Tcl/Tk documention specific to that version.
	

Shelve- The shelve module in Python’s standard library is a simple yet effective tool for persistent data storage when using a relational database solution is not required. The shelf object defined in this module is dictionary-like object which is persistently stored in a disk file. This creates afile similar to dbm database on UNIX like systems. Only string data type can be used as key in this special dictionary object, whereas any picklable object can serve as value.


OS- The OS module in python provides functions for interacting with the operating system. OS, comes under Python’s standard utility modules. This module provides a portable way of using operating system dependent functionality. The os and os.path modules include many functions to interact with the file system.


Datetime -The datetime module supplies classes for manipulating dates and times in both simple and complex ways. While date and time arithmetic is supported, the focus of the implementation is on efficient attribute extraction for output formatting and manipulation. For related functionality, see also the time and calendar modules.
